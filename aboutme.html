        <h3>
          I am a student, Aspiring to be a forntend-devloper. Powered by Figma,
          VS Code and coffee. graduate of Internet Technology. I create
          successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best
          practices. I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a
          modern website requires the combination of design, server technology,
          and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience
          in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user
          experiences.

          Everthing starting from the initial animation to sticky nav bar has
          been purely coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some of the features
          are explained in detail below
          <br />

          1. The on hover button was made mouse over and mouse out which triggred
          certain functions and lead to the cool animation effect
        <br>
        2.The loading page animation was built by using 2 div classes moving in a centain manner. For learning more about div 
        tag. I have used a site called CSS battles (no animation). its completly uses css to make cool patters and logos
        <br>
        3.The sticky Nav bar

        <br>
        4.The color changing header , It was made by adding a gif to the background which make the text glow in a pattern 
        usually not visible to the naked eye
